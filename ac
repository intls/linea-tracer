# SELFDESTRUCT testing

- STATICX
	- i.e. done in an execution context spawned through STATICCALL
- OOGX
	- zero / nonzero balance
	- warmth / cold recipient
	- self recipient
	- new account cost for recipient
- REVERT'ed later or not
- inside of a CREATE / deployment transaction
	- leads to early deployment of empty code
	- said account will be wiped off the world later
	- can still have storage in the mean time

- carried out several times in the same account, same transaction
- reverted yes or no at the end
- done indirectly (i.e. through DELEGATECALL / CALLCODE)
- interaction with storage

More involved:
- deploying from an account MARKED_FOR_SELFDESTRUCT
- deploying with CREATE from an account MARKED_FOR_SELFDESTRUCT

This would be to reproduce CREATE address collisions


# PRC calls

- all 9 precompiles
- testing all possible success / failure paths (some extensive work was already done for EC stuff)
- in particular for gas
- testing variations on CALLDATA
- testing the output RETURNDATA
- interaction with DELEGATECALL / CALLCODE ?
